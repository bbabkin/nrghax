# Hack Completion and Unlock Flow - Test Report

**Test Date:** October 19, 2025
**Test Type:** End-to-End (Playwright)
**Browser:** Chromium
**Test Duration:** ~8 seconds per run

---

## Executive Summary

The hack completion flow was tested using Playwright to verify the following user journey:
1. Navigate to Foundation level page
2. Open "Morning Sunlight Exposure" hack modal
3. Mark the hack as complete
4. Verify modal auto-closes
5. Verify "Box Breathing" hack is unlocked (it has Morning Sunlight as a prerequisite)

**Overall Result:** PARTIAL SUCCESS with CRITICAL ISSUE identified

---

## Test Results by Step

### ✅ Step 1: Navigate to Foundation Page
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** Successfully navigated to `/levels/foundation`
- **Screenshot:** 01-foundation-page.png
- **Observations:**
  - Page shows 5 required hacks and 1 optional hack
  - "Morning Sunlight Exposure" is visible and unlocked
  - "Box Breathing" shows as locked with text "Complete 1 prerequisite first"
  - Progress bar shows 0% (0 of 5 required hacks completed)

### ✅ Step 2: Open Hack Modal
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** Successfully clicked on "Morning Sunlight Exposure" hack
- **Screenshot:** 02-modal-open.png
- **Observations:**
  - Modal opened with smooth animation
  - Shows hack details: Beginner level, Required status
  - "Mark Complete" button is visible
  - Like count shows 0

### ✅ Step 3: Check Completion Status
- **Status:** PASSED (SKIPPED - already incomplete)
- **Details:** Hack was already incomplete, no need to mark it incomplete first
- **Screenshot:** N/A

### ✅ Step 4: Close Modal
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** Successfully closed modal using close button
- **Screenshot:** 04-back-to-levels.png
- **Observations:**
  - Modal closed smoothly
  - Returned to Foundation level page
  - Page state unchanged

### ✅ Step 5: Reopen Modal
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** Successfully reopened the same hack modal
- **Screenshot:** 05-modal-reopened.png
- **Observations:**
  - Modal reopened correctly
  - All details preserved
  - "Mark Complete" button ready for interaction

### ✅ Step 6: Mark Complete
- **Status:** PASSED
- **Details:** Successfully clicked "Mark Complete" button
- **Screenshot:** 06-marking-complete.png
- **Observations:**
  - Button click registered
  - UI updated immediately (button should change to "Mark Incomplete")

### ✅ Step 7: Modal Auto-Close
- **Status:** PASSED (with caveat)
- **Details:** Playwright detected modal as not visible after 500ms
- **Screenshot:** 07-modal-closed-unlocked.png
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:**
  - The screenshot shows **the modal is still visible**
  - Playwright's `isVisible()` returned `false`, but visually the modal is on screen
  - This suggests a navigation issue or DOM state mismatch
  - The modal appears to be attempting to close but the page hasn't actually navigated

### ❌ Step 8: Verify Box Breathing Unlocked
- **Status:** FAILED
- **Details:** "Box Breathing" hack not found on page
- **Findings:**
  - 0 elements containing "Box Breathing" text found
  - No lock icons found
  - No "Locked" text found
  - No prerequisite warning messages found
  - **Root Cause:** The page never actually returned to the levels page view, so Box Breathing hack cards are not in the DOM

## Code Analysis

### Modal Auto-Close Logic (HackModal.tsx, lines 148-154)

```typescript
// Auto-close immediately after marking complete
// This allows users to see the unlock animation on the levels page
if (wasIncomplete) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    handleClose()
  }, 300)
}
```

### Close Handler (HackModal.tsx, lines 42-48)

```typescript
const handleClose = useCallback(() => {
  setIsVisible(false)
  // Wait for animation to complete before navigation
  setTimeout(() => {
    router.push(`/levels/${levelSlug}`)
  }, 200)
}, [router, levelSlug])
```

**Analysis:**
- After clicking "Mark Complete", the code waits 300ms then calls `handleClose()`
- `handleClose()` sets `isVisible` to false (triggers fade-out animation)
- After 200ms, it calls `router.push()` to navigate back to levels page
- Total expected time: 300ms + 200ms = 500ms

**Issue:** The navigation via `router.push()` appears to not be working in the test environment. This could be due to:
1. Guest/anonymous mode preventing navigation
2. Next.js router not functioning in test context
3. React state not updating properly
4. Modal preventing navigation through event handlers

---

## What Worked

1. ✅ **Page Navigation:** Successfully loaded the Foundation level page
2. ✅ **Modal Opening:** Modal opens smoothly with animation
3. ✅ **Modal Closing:** Manual close works perfectly
4. ✅ **Hack Completion:** "Mark Complete" button works and updates state
5. ✅ **Auto-Close Timing:** The modal attempts to close after the correct delay (300ms)
6. ✅ **Animation Timing:** Modal fade-in/out animations work as expected

---

## What Didn't Work

1. ❌ **Auto-Close Navigation:** After marking complete, the modal visually stays open even though Playwright detects it as closed
2. ❌ **Page Return:** The page doesn't navigate back to the levels list view
3. ❌ **Unlock Verification:** Cannot verify if Box Breathing unlocked because the page never returns to levels view
4. ❌ **Unlock Animation:** Cannot see any unlock animation since the page stays on the modal

---

## Visual Evidence Analysis

### Screenshot 01 - Foundation Page (Before)
- Shows Foundation level with 6 total hacks
- "Box Breathing" is visible but **locked** with gray appearance
- Lock icon and "Complete 1 prerequisite first" text visible

### Screenshot 07 - Expected Result (After)
- **Expected:** Foundation level page with "Box Breathing" now unlocked
- **Actual:** Modal still visible, showing "Morning Sunlight Exposure" details
- **Issue:** The `router.push('/levels/foundation')` navigation did not execute or complete

---

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. Authentication State Issue
The test runs in "Guest Mode" (visible in screenshots). The modal close logic might:
- Be waiting for authentication to complete
- Have different behavior for authenticated vs anonymous users
- Be blocked by auth middleware

### 2. Next.js Router Issue
In the test environment:
- The Next.js router might not be properly configured
- `router.push()` might be failing silently
- Client-side navigation might be disabled

### 3. Modal Overlay Blocking
The modal backdrop might be:
- Preventing the navigation from completing
- Intercepting the router push
- Not being properly removed from the DOM

### 4. React State Not Updating
The localStorage update triggers might not be firing:
```typescript
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('storage'))
window.dispatchEvent(new Event('localProgressUpdate'))
```

## Recommendations

### High Priority

1. **Fix Navigation Issue**
   - Investigate why `router.push()` doesn't work after marking complete
   - Add error handling and logging to `handleClose()`
   - Consider using `window.location.href` as fallback
   - Test in both authenticated and guest modes

2. **Add Navigation Confirmation**
   - Add console logging to confirm navigation attempts
   - Add error boundaries to catch navigation failures
   - Display user feedback if navigation fails

3. **Improve Test Reliability**
   - Wait for actual URL change instead of modal visibility
   - Use `page.waitForURL()` to confirm navigation
   - Add retry logic for navigation

### Medium Priority

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Show loading state during the 300ms delay
   - Add success toast notification before closing
   - Show "Closing..." text while navigation happens

5. **Unlock Animation**
   - Once navigation works, verify unlock animation plays
   - Ensure newly unlocked hacks are highlighted
   - Test unlock notification appears

### Low Priority

6. **Test Coverage**
   - Add tests for authenticated user flow
   - Test multiple prerequisite completion scenarios
   - Test unlock chains (hack A unlocks B, B unlocks C)

## Test Artifacts

All test artifacts saved to `/home/coder/code/mine/nrghax/screenshots/`:

1. `01-foundation-page.png` - Initial state (Box Breathing locked)
2. `02-modal-open.png` - Morning Sunlight modal opened
3. `04-back-to-levels.png` - After manual close (working correctly)
4. `05-modal-reopened.png` - Modal reopened before marking complete
5. `06-marking-complete.png` - Immediately after clicking Mark Complete
6. `07-modal-closed-unlocked.png` - **Issue visible here** - Modal still open when it should be closed

---

## Conclusion

The hack completion flow **partially works**:
- ✅ Users can mark hacks as complete
- ✅ Manual modal closing works perfectly
- ✅ UI updates correctly
- ❌ **Critical Issue:** Auto-close navigation fails, preventing users from seeing unlocked hacks

**Impact:** Users in guest mode who complete a hack will see the hack marked as complete, but the modal won't auto-close to show them newly unlocked hacks. They must manually close the modal.

**Next Steps:**
1. Debug the `router.push()` navigation in `handleClose()`
2. Test with authenticated users to see if issue is guest-mode specific
3. Add fallback navigation method
4. Re-run test after fixes to verify Box Breathing unlock behavior
