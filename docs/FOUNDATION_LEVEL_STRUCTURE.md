## Database Structure

### Tables Used
- `hacks` - The 5 hack records

- `hack_prerequisites` - 5 prerequisite relationships
- `user_hacks` - Tracks completion status
- `user_hack_checks` - Tracks checklist progress
- `user_levels` - Tracks level progress

### Key Queries

**Check if hack is unlocked:**
```sql
SELECT is_hack_unlocked(hack_id, user_id);
```

**Get user's progress:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_user_level_tree(user_id);
```

**Check if all required checks are complete:**
```sql
SELECT can_complete_hack(hack_id, user_id);
```

## Migration File

The structure is defined in:
- `supabase/migrations/20251019200000_foundation_level_structure.sql`

This migration:
1. Deletes all hacks except the 5 Foundation hacks
2. Sets proper positions (0-4)
3. Assigns all to Foundation level
4. Creates prerequisite relationships
5. Ensures all hacks have complete checklists

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Progressive Learning**: Users start simple and build up
2. **Clear Path**: Obvious progression through the level
3. **Choice**: After Box Breathing, users can choose between Pomodoro or Cold Shower
4. **Gating**: Power Pose requires mastery of multiple skills
5. **Demonstrates Prerequisites**: Good for testing the prerequisite system
6. **Manageable Scope**: 5 hacks is enough to learn without being overwhelming
7. **Complete Checklists**: Every hack has 4 items for consistent UX

## Future Enhancements

- Add more levels (Direction, Movement, etc.)
- Create different prerequisite patterns
- Add difficulty progression
- Implement time-based unlocks
- Add achievements for completion streaks
