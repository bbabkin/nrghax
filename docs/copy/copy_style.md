- Generates "telling my friends" behavior

## Remember

We're building the first egregore designed to free people, not trap them. Our copy should reflect that paradox - using engagement techniques to teach disengagement, using viral mechanics to spread sovereignty.

Every word should serve liberation, not capture.
