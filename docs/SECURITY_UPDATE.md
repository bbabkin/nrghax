# Security Update Complete âœ…

## Date: January 14, 2025

### Issue Resolved
- Discord bot token was accidentally exposed in git history
- Token appeared in documentation file (`docs/RASPBERRY_PI_BOT_DEPLOYMENT.md`)

### Actions Taken
1. âœ… **Removed secret from all files** - Replaced with placeholders
2. âœ… **Cleaned git history** - Used `git filter-branch` to remove all instances
3. âœ… **Force pushed clean history** - Repository no longer contains the token
4. âœ… **Regenerated Discord token** - Old token is now invalid
5. âœ… **Updated bot configuration** - Bot running with new token
6. âœ… **Bot verified working** - Successfully connected and responding

### Current Status
- **Bot Status**: âœ… Running with new token
- **Repository**: âœ… Clean (no secrets in history)
- **Documentation**: âœ… Uses placeholders only
- **Security**: âœ… Enhanced

### Prevention Measures Implemented
1. All documentation now uses placeholder values
2. `.env` files are properly gitignored
3. Created security cleanup script for future reference

### For Team Members
If you have a local clone, please run:
```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### New Bot Token
The new token is stored securely in:
- Local `.env` files (not in git)
- Discord developer portal
- Will be added to production environment variables during deployment

### Lessons Learned
- Always use placeholders in documentation
- Never commit real credentials, even temporarily
- GitHub's push protection is helpful for catching these issues
- Quick response prevents token abuse

## No Security Breach Detected
- Token was caught by GitHub before being publicly accessible
- No unauthorized bot usage detected
- Swift remediation completed within minutes
