# Hack Checklist Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the checklist feature for hacks, including full support for anonymous users with seamless migration when they register.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

**Tables Created:**
- `hack_checks`: Stores checklist items for each hack
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `hack_id`: Foreign key to hacks table
  - `title`: Check item title
  - `description`: Rich HTML description
  - `position`: Order of the item (0-indexed)
  - `is_required`: Boolean - whether the check is required for completion
  - Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`

- `user_hack_checks`: Tracks which checks each user has completed
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `user_id`: Foreign key to profiles table
  - `hack_check_id`: Foreign key to hack_checks table
  - `completed_at`: Timestamp when completed (NULL if not completed)
  - Unique constraint on (user_id, hack_check_id)

**Database Functions:**
- `can_complete_hack(p_hack_id, p_user_id)`: Returns TRUE if all required checks are completed
- `get_hack_check_progress(p_hack_id, p_user_id)`: Returns progress statistics (total, completed, required, etc.)

**RLS Policies:**
- Users can read all hack_checks
- Users can read/insert/update their own user_hack_checks records

### 2. Server Actions

**File:** `src/lib/hacks/supabase-actions.ts`

New functions:
- `getHackChecks(hackId)`: Fetch all checks for a hack (ordered by position)
- `getUserCheckProgress(hackId)`: Get user's completed checks for a hack
- `toggleCheckItem(checkId, completed)`: Mark a check as completed/uncompleted
- `canCompleteHack(hackId)`: Check if user can complete the hack
- `getHackCheckProgress(hackId)`: Get progress statistics

Modified:
- `markHackCompleted()`: Now validates that all required checks are completed before allowing hack completion

### 3. UI Components

**ChecklistItem Component** (`src/components/hacks/ChecklistItem.tsx`):
- Individual checklist item with checkbox
- Shows title and rich HTML description
- Displays "Required" or "Optional" badge
- Check mark icon when completed
- Line-through styling for completed items
- Optimistic UI updates
- Works for both authenticated and anonymous users

**Checklist Component** (`src/components/hacks/Checklist.tsx`):
- Container for all checklist items
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Counter showing X/Y checks completed
- Alert message if required checks aren't complete
- Optional encouragement message for completing optional checks
- localStorage integration for anonymous users
- Automatically recalculates progress

### 4. Integration Points

**HackModal** (`src/components/levels/HackModal.tsx`):
- Added checklist section below hack description
- Mark Complete button now:
  - Disables if required checks aren't done
  - Shows AlertCircle icon when disabled
  - Has tooltip explaining why it's disabled
- Progress badge in button showing X/Y checks

**HackView** (`src/components/hacks/HackView.tsx`):
- Same checklist integration as HackModal
- Full-page view also respects check completion requirements

### 5. Anonymous User Support

**localStorage Management** (`src/lib/levels/localStorage.ts`):

New storage keys:
- `hack_checks_{hackId}`: Array of completed check IDs for each hack

New functions:
- `getAllHackCheckProgress()`: Scans localStorage for all check progress
- `getHackCheckProgress(hackId)`: Gets check progress for specific hack
- `exportLocalProgress()`: Exports all progress including checks
- `clearLocalProgress()`: Clears all progress including checks
- `getLocalProgressSummary()`: Returns summary including check stats

Helper functions in Checklist.tsx:
- `getLocalCheckProgress(hackId)`: Read check progress from localStorage
- `saveLocalCheckProgress(hackId, completedIds)`: Save check progress to localStorage

### 6. Progress Migration

**Migration Function** (`src/lib/levels/migrateProgress.ts`):
- Updated to handle hack check progress migration
- When user signs in/up:
  - Reads all completed checks from localStorage
  - Creates `user_hack_checks` records in database
  - Handles existing records (doesn't duplicate)
  - Migrates hacks, levels, AND checks
  - Returns success/error status

**Migration Hook** (`src/hooks/useProgressMigration.ts`):
- React hook that automatically triggers migration
- Detects when user becomes authenticated
- Exports local progress
- Calls migration function
- Clears localStorage on success
- Dispatches event to trigger UI updates
- Only runs once per session

**Progress Provider** (`src/components/ProgressMigrationProvider.tsx`):
- Client component wrapper
- Listens for auth state changes
- Triggers migration hook when user signs in
- Integrated into root layout

### 7. Sample Data

**Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251019193648_seed_tags_and_more_checks.sql`
- Seeds 12 tags (Sleep, Nutrition, Exercise, Mental Health, etc.)
- Adds checklists to various hacks:
  - Cold exposure hacks (4 checks)
  - Breathing hacks (5 checks)
  - Sleep hacks (4 checks)
  - Exercise hacks (4 checks)
  - Nutrition hacks (5 checks)
- Associates tags with relevant hacks

## User Flow

### Anonymous User:
1. Opens a hack and sees checklist
2. Checks off items (saved to localStorage)
3. Can't mark hack complete until required checks are done
4. Progress persists across page refreshes
5. All data stored locally in browser

### Registration/Sign-in:
1. User creates account or signs in
2. ProgressMigrationProvider detects auth change
3. Migration hook automatically runs after 1 second
4. All localStorage data is synced to database:
   - Completed hacks
   - Visited hacks
   - Level progress
   - **Check completions**
5. localStorage is cleared
6. User seamlessly continues with database-backed progress

### Authenticated User:
1. All checklist progress stored in database
2. Syncs across devices
3. No localStorage involved
4. Real-time updates via Supabase

## Technical Decisions

### Why localStorage for anonymous users?
- No backend roundtrips = faster UX
- Works offline
- No authentication required
- Easy to implement and test
- Seamless migration path

### Why optimistic UI updates?
- Better perceived performance
- Instant feedback to user
- Falls back gracefully on errors

### Why separate tables for checks?
- Flexibility to add checks to any hack
- Reusable check definitions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to query and aggregate

### Why RLS policies?
- Security by default
- Users can only modify their own progress
- All users can read check definitions
- Admin operations use service role

### Why mark checks as required/optional?
- Flexibility in learning paths
- Clear expectations for users
- Some checks are informational only
- Required checks enforce proper completion

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not currently implemented):
1. Check templates for common patterns
2. Conditional checks (show based on other selections)
3. Check dependencies (unlock checks sequentially)
4. Time tracking per check
5. Notes/comments on individual checks
6. Check completion analytics
7. Gamification (achievements for check streaks)
8. Social features (share progress with friends)
9. Export progress as PDF/markdown
10. Import checklists from external sources

## Accessibility

- All checkboxes are keyboard accessible
- Labels are properly associated with inputs
- Color is not the only indicator of state
- Icons supplement text labels
- Focus indicators are visible
- Screen reader compatible

## Performance Considerations

- Checks are fetched once per hack view
- Progress calculations are memoized
- localStorage operations are minimal
- Database queries use indexes
- RLS policies are optimized
- No polling or subscriptions (could add for real-time)

## Browser Compatibility

- Works in all modern browsers
- localStorage is widely supported
- Graceful degradation if storage is disabled
- Server-side rendering compatible
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Security

- All database access uses RLS
- User can only modify their own checks
- SQL injection prevented by parameterized queries
- XSS prevented by React (description uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML but content is admin-controlled)
- No sensitive data in localStorage
- Migration validates user ID from auth session

## Deployment Notes

1. Run database migrations in order
2. Regenerate TypeScript types
3. Deploy code changes
4. Test with anonymous user
5. Test with authenticated user
6. Test migration flow
7. Monitor logs for migration errors

## Success Metrics

To measure feature success, track:
- % of hacks with checklists
- Average checks per hack
- % of users completing all required checks
- Time to complete first check
- Check completion rate before/after sign-in
- Migration success rate
- localStorage errors
- User feedback on check usefulness
