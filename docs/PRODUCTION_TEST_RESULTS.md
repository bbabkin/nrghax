- Verified working in production

**Test Evidence:**

2. Looking for like button...
  ✅ Found like button (shows: 0)
  Clicked like button
  Current URL: https://www.nrghax.com/auth
  ✅ SUCCESS: Redirected to auth page as expected!
  ✅ Auth page has login form ready

## Recommendations

## Conclusion
Production deployment is working correctly with the main user flows functional. The critical bug where unauthenticated users encountered errors when liking hacks has been successfully fixed - they are now properly redirected to the login page as requested.
