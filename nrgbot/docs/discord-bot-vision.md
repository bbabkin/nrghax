## Working Ideas

### Role System Concept
**Entry Point Questionnaire:**
- **Need-based questions:**
  - Do you lack energy?
  - Do you lack concentration?
  - Is there somebody who is hurting you energetically?
  
- **Learning preference questions:**
  - Quick sessions or longer sessions?
  - General level of acquaintance with energy work
  - Level of skepticism towards the information

**Role Assignment:**
- Based on primary need (Energy Seeker, Focus Builder, Shield Learner)
- Combined with learning style (Quick Learner, Deep Diver)
- Skepticism level affects content presentation

### Achievement Categories
*Preliminary thoughts*
- Knowledge milestones
- Consistency rewards (daily streaks)
- Community contribution
- Peer helping/mentoring

### Resource Glimpse Features
- Daily featured resource
- Personalized recommendations
