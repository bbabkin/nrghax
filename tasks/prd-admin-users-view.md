# PRD: Admin Users View Feature

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces basic administrative functionality to the application by allowing designated admin users to view a list of all registered users. The first registered user in the system will automatically be designated as the admin. This is the foundation for future admin capabilities, starting with read-only user management.

## Goals

1. Enable admin users to view a complete list of all registered users in the system
2. Establish the foundation for future admin features by implementing basic role-based access
3. Provide visibility into the user base for site owners
4. Integrate admin functionality seamlessly into the existing UI

## User Stories

1. **As an admin**, I want to view a list of all registered users so that I can understand who is using the platform
2. **As an admin**, I want to access admin features through the same interface as regular features so that I have a consistent experience
3. **As a regular user**, I should not see or have access to admin functionality so that system security is maintained

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must designate the first registered user as an admin
2. The system must provide a "Users" page accessible only to admin users
3. The Users page must display a list/table of all registered users showing:
   - User ID or unique identifier
   - Email address
   - Display name (if available)
   - Registration date
   - Last login date (if tracked)
4. The system must show an admin-only navigation item (e.g., "Users" link) that is only visible when an admin is logged in
5. The system must redirect non-admin users to the home page or show a 403 error if they attempt to access the Users page directly
6. The Users list should support basic pagination if there are many users (optional for initial version)
7. The system must integrate the admin features into the existing UI without requiring a separate admin panel

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User editing capabilities
- User deletion functionality
- User suspension or banning
- Bulk user operations
- User search or filtering (beyond basic pagination)
- Multiple admin roles or permission levels
- Admin activity logging
- Two-factor authentication for admin access
- Resource management (covered in separate PRD)
- Email notifications to users
- User profile details beyond basic information

## Design Considerations

- The Users page should follow the existing application's design system and components
- Use the same navigation structure with an additional "Users" menu item visible only to admins
- The users list should be presented in a clean, readable table format
- Consider using the existing table components or data grid if available
- Mobile responsive design should be maintained

## Technical Considerations

1. **Authentication/Authorization:**
   - Extend existing Supabase auth to check if user is admin
   - Consider adding an `is_admin` flag to user profiles or creating a separate admins table
   - First user detection can be based on user creation timestamp

2. **Database:**
   - May need to add admin flag to profiles table
   - Ensure RLS policies allow admins to read all user data while regular users cannot

3. **Frontend:**
   - Conditionally render admin navigation items based on user role
   - Implement route protection for admin pages
   - Use existing component library for consistency

4. **Performance:**
   - Implement pagination if user count exceeds reasonable display limits (e.g., 50-100 users per page)

## Success Metrics

1. Admin user can successfully log in and see the Users navigation item
2. Admin can view the complete list of registered users
3. Non-admin users cannot see or access the Users page
4. Page loads within 2 seconds for up to 1000 users
5. Zero security breaches related to unauthorized access to user data
6. Feature is deployed without breaking existing functionality

## Open Questions

1. Should the admin assignment be based on registration order (first user) or should there be a manual process to designate admins later?
2. What specific user information should be displayed in the list? (Current assumption: email, name, registration date, last login)
3. Should we implement pagination immediately or wait to see actual user growth?
4. How should we handle the edge case where there are no users yet?
5. Should admin status be revocable or permanent once assigned?
6. Do we need to show any user status indicators (e.g., active, inactive, email verified)?
