# Energy Programming and Goal Achievement

## Foundation Principles

### Post-Shield Programming
- After shield integration, no longer coordinated by collective thought
- Must learn to program ourselves and coordinate with others
- Use same methods as collective unconscious, but with personal direction
- Shield essential to prevent collective influence on chosen direction

### Core Programming Concept
- Takes fraction of effort to solve challenges on subtle plane vs physical
- Applies to: health, habits, relationships, goals
- Effective emission creates ideas in others they think are their own
- Must "spend energy to make energy" - emit to be heard

## Three Primary Programs

### 1. Luck Program (Self-Programming)

**Purpose**: Engage subconscious in finding ways to achieve goals
**Energy Flow**: Uses Upflow (emotions)
**Target**: Yourself

**Goal Creation Process**:
1. Picture goal + focus on strong upflow
2. Why do you need it? + more upflow  
3. When? + more upflow
4. Focus on images following all steps
5. Who involved, what must they do? + more upflow
6. What changes after achievement? + more upflow
7. Repeat several times with visualization

**Goal Validation Method**:
1. Enter base state slowly and vividly
2. Bring integrated goal feeling into base state
3. Imagine entering empty theatre in base state
4. Watch goal highlights on screen (no control)
5. Allow goal to change or be rejected by subconscious
6. Accept whatever emerges as validated goal

**Integration Process**:
1. Visualize validated goal (may appear as energy ball)
2. Take with subtle hands, place in solar plexus inside shield
3. Turn into filter that upflow passes through
4. Goal becomes part of you, filling shield completely

**Usage During Interactions**:
- Use arrow at base of head to control upflow direction
- Aim forward when conversation about your goal
- Aim upward when conversation not relevant
- People become more willing to discuss and help

**Cautions**:
- Goals destined to come true, sometimes in unwanted ways
- Example: Wanting relatives to visit â†’ getting sick needing care
- Validate each step with base state to prevent unwanted solutions

### 2. Effectiveness Program (Programming Others)

**Purpose**: Coordinate others' behavior to support your goals
**Energy Flow**: Uses Downflow (thoughts)  
**Target**: Other people

**Goal Creation for Others**:
1. Remember people involved in goal + focus/strengthen downflow
2. What these people must do + downflow
3. When/where + downflow  
4. How you'll feel after completion + more downflow
5. Cycle through: who, what, how, where, when, feelings + downflow

**Characteristics**:
- Feels different from upflow goal creation
- Less vivid and colorful than upflow version
- Like watching movie in fast-forward learning plot without emotion
- Don't validate with base state (not for you, for others)
- Visualize goal representation on subtle plane

**Implementation**:
1. Drag goal representation into solar plexus (use subtle body if needed)
2. Use as filter for downflow
3. Picture arrow below navel, aim at other person
4. Project goal during conversation with strong initial pressure
5. Process becomes automatic after initial projection

**Three Critical Rules**:
1. **One goal at a time** - goals need time to develop
2. **Positive formulation only** - no negatives ('I want you happy' not 'don't be angry')
3. **Never verbally communicate intent** - triggers defensiveness, ruins exercise

### 3. Self-Confidence Program (Authority Projection)

**Purpose**: Project self-assurance and authority when needed
**Energy Flow**: Uses Upflow with specific emotional filter
**Target**: Others (never use on yourself)

**Emotional Foundation**:
- Recall telemarketer scenario: polite person not respecting your time
- Focus on moment of drawing line between your needs and others'
- Capture feeling of standing ground, protecting what's yours
- Notice how it makes "blood boil" - old survival feeling
- Important: Don't want this state constantly (would become sociopath)

**Alternate Base State Creation**:
1. Pick pleasant memory different from regular base state
2. Ensure clearly remembered and associated with positive things
3. Add contrasting element that doesn't belong logically
4. Examples: snowman on summer beach, red phone booth in forest
5. Element should be likeable and fun

**Programming Process**:
1. Replay telemarketer scenario for fresh self-protection feeling
2. Make feeling as strong as possible
3. Strengthen upflow using feeling as filter
4. Project upflow toward contrasting element with full force
5. Discard state after programming

**Usage**: 
- Recall moment and element when self-assurance needed
- Only direct at others, never use for self-programming
- For self-programming (habits, etc.), use Luck program instead

## Advanced Integration Techniques

### Combining All Three Programs
**Sequence for Maximum Effectiveness**:

1. **Setup Phase**: Program yourself with validated goal using Luck program
2. **Preparation Phase**: Use Effectiveness program with downflow 
   - Begin emitting goal that gets picked up by other person
   - Don't discuss goal verbally yet ("adding lighter fluid")
3. **Activation Phase**: When person gets "warmer" to topic
   - Project upflow at them (Luck program approach)  
   - Strengthen based on their warmth level
4. **Confirmation Phase**: When they say what you want
   - Agree while projecting confidence (Self-Confidence program)
   - This is "adding match to lighter fluid"

### Duality Resolution (Removing Internal Conflicts)

**Common Childhood Conflicts**:
- Example: Boy pushed cat after scratch, mother scolds for being mean
- Creates internal conflict: defend self vs be "morally right"
- Results in guilt regardless of choice made
- Another example: Childhood mischief creating guilt-punishment-absolution cycle

**Resolution Process**:
1. **Identify**: Recognize pivotal childhood moments creating conflicts
2. **Confront**: Don't suppress these memories, examine them
3. **Reinterpret**: Understand context and motivations
4. **Forgive**: Both yourself and others involved
5. **Acknowledge**: Harm likely unintentional, or you've outgrown it
6. **Reprogram**: Align conscious and unconscious for desired life

**Result**: Break cycle of guilt, self-punishment, and repeated patterns

## Implementation Guidelines

### Energy Emission Rules
- Must emit constantly to be heard in current environment
- Collective unconscious uses person's emotions to trigger defensiveness
- Takes context out of whatever you're trying to convey
- Must play by invisible framework rules to have chance at winning

### Moral Considerations
- Not brainwashing if message is beneficial
- Choice: Influence positively or let collective unconscious influence negatively
- Act as "liberator" rather than manipulator
- Consider what message you're sending before judging method

### Safety Protocols
- **Critical**: Must have shield integrated before programming
- Without shield: "Fast car with crazy passenger grabbing wheel"
- Passenger is collective thought and its after-effects
- Can work initially but creates unexpected/undesirable long-term effects

### Success Indicators
- People respond more positively to your goals
- Goals manifest with less effort
- Others generate ideas supporting your objectives
- Increased coordination and cooperation
- Decreased resistance to your initiatives

## Troubleshooting

### Common Mistakes
- **Luck Program**: Using on others instead of self
- **Effectiveness**: Discussing goal verbally (triggers resistance)
- **Self-Confidence**: Using on self instead of others
- **General**: Attempting without proper shield integration

### Timing Issues
- **Too Fast**: Goals need time to manifest
- **Impatience**: Trying to force verbal communication of intent
- **Overuse**: Multiple goals simultaneously (reduces effectiveness)

### Integration Problems
- **Insufficient Shield**: Must be integrated for weeks before programming
- **Weak Flows**: Need strong up/down flows for effective programming
- **Base State Issues**: Goals not properly validated can manifest incorrectly
