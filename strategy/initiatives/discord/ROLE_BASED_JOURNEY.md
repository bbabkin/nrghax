## 🎯 The Vision

Users enter with specific problems, receive targeted solutions, master them, then transcend the need for categorization. The role system is scaffolding that eventually gets removed, leaving a sovereign practitioner who helps others climb the same ladder.

**Success = Users who no longer need roles**

Every role is a temporary tool, not an identity. The system guides users from "I have this problem" to "I've mastered this solution" to "I can help others with this journey."
