## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Clean up Discord:**
   - Simplify channel description
   - Create basic channel structure
   - Set community guidelines

2. **Portal MVP:**
   - Implement daily check-in
   - Add first achievement badge
   - Create Energy Ball module

3. **Basic Bot:**
   - Set up bot application
   - Implement /checkin command
   - Connect to Supabase

4. **Community Seeding:**
   - Find 10 beta testers
   - Daily engagement for first week
   - Gather feedback for iteration

## The North Star

Every feature should answer YES to:
- Does it teach energy sovereignty?
- Does it encourage peer learning over guru dependency?
- Does it celebrate graduation over retention?
- Does it work without the platform?

**Success = Users who no longer need us**

## Key Refinements from Discussion

### The Hook: Variable Reward Power-Ups
- Not passive check-ins but active daily power-ups
- Users select what they need, get different hack each time
- Builds natural progression and understanding of their needs

### Gateway Hacks That Actually Work
- **Eye Massage**: Instant relief, stealth hack for screen workers
- **Pain Unwind**: Visual/imagination based, works immediately
- **Warm Liquid**: Proven relaxation that primes energy sensing

### The Positioning: "RPG Magic That's Real"
- Frame as learning actual abilities/skills
- Practical, defiant of orthodox science
- Not wellness mysticism but reality cheat codes
- "For people too smart for self-help, too practical for spirituality"

### Early Adopter Profile
- Open-minded but not gullible
- Psychology interest but know its limits
- Challenging childhood â early maturity + retained wonder
- Natural philosophers who test everything

### Discord-First Until Critical Mass
- Test hacks with small group before full portal build
- Community validation more important than platform initially
- Bot development can validate what works
