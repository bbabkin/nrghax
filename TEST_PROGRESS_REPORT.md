```

### Failing Tests (To Fix)
1. HackCard Component - likes/completion count display
2. HackCard Component - locked state display
3. HackCard Component - external link display

## 📈 Path to 80% Coverage

### Immediate Priorities (Week 1)
1. **Fix Component Tests** (3 failing tests)
   - Update mock implementations
   - Fix assertion expectations

2. **Add Server Action Tests**
   - Test hack CRUD operations
   - Test authentication actions
   - Test user profile updates

3. **Add Route Handler Tests**
   - Test auth routes (login, signup, oauth)
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test middleware functionality

### Next Phase (Week 2)
1. **Complete E2E Test Suite**
   - Full admin workflow
   - User journey tests
   - Error handling scenarios

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Database operations with real Supabase
   - RLS policy verification
   - Authentication flow integration

3. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Component screenshots
   - Page layout tests
   - Responsive design tests

## 🛠️ Commands for Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage

```

## 📝 Key Achievements

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Fully configured with industry-standard tools
2. **Test Coverage**: Increased from 0% to ~15-20%
3. **Test Suite**: 26 tests implemented across 4 modules
4. **Pass Rate**: 88% of tests passing
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing guide created

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix the 3 failing component tests
2. Add tests for server actions and routes
3. Increase coverage to 50% by end of week
4. Achieve 80% coverage target within 2 weeks

The testing foundation is now solid and ready for expansion. The infrastructure supports comprehensive testing at all levels (unit, integration, E2E), following Supabase and Next.js best practices.
