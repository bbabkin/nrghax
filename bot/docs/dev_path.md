# Discord Bot Development Path

## Overview
This document outlines the incremental development path for the NrgHax Discord bot, providing specific PRD prompts that can be given to the discord-bot-developer agent to build the bot step by step.

## Development Philosophy
- **Incremental Building**: Each phase builds on the previous
- **Integration First**: Ensure Discord-Website sync from the start
- **User Experience Focus**: Follow the life hacker friend personality
- **Test as You Go**: Each phase should be fully tested before moving on

## Project Structure

- [ ] Error cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Bot personality is consistent
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (<500ms response)
- [ ] Integration with website works (if applicable)
- [ ] User feedback is positive

## Questions for Clarification

Before starting development, please clarify:

1. **Hosting**: Where will the bot be hosted? (VPS, cloud, serverless?)
2. **User Scale**: Expected number of users in first month?
3. **Premium Features**: Any paid tier considerations?
4. **Moderation**: How strict should content moderation be?
5. **Languages**: English only or multi-language support?
6. **Mobile**: Special considerations for mobile Discord users?
7. **Events**: Should the bot handle voice channel events?

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs throughout development:
- User registration rate
- Daily active users
- Average session length
- Command usage frequency
- User retention (7-day, 30-day)
- Practice completion rate
- Social interaction rate
- Website ‚Üî Discord cross-usage

## Notes

- Each PRD prompt can be given independently to the discord-bot-developer agent
- Prompts are designed to be specific enough for implementation but flexible for optimization
- The personality and tone from UX.md should be maintained throughout
- Integration with the existing Next.js/Supabase setup is critical
- The 60/40 Discord/Website split should guide feature priorities
